###### A simple chat application using Python

This application uses two nodes, namely a Host and a Server. One socket(node) listens on a particular
port at an IP, while other socket reaches out to the other to form a connection. The Socket Library
of Python is used to provide a form of inter-process communication.

Steps to make it work:
1) Open any CLI and run SERVER.py file
2) Open another tab on your terminal and run the HOST file.
3) Now send and receive messages as per the instructions given in the terminal.
